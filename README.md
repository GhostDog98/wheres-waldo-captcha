# Where is waldo?
In this captcha!

A fun little project to embed waldo into a fake captcha after i saw a joke reddit post suggesting it. 
All of the CSS comes from googles official captcha code, so i do not own it.

TODO:
- Make captcha button show the menu
- Fix captcha disclaimer text alignment (strangly this happens on googles own iframe embed, I wonder what they do to prevent this?)
- Add detents to images when you select them
- Add support for multiple images more easily?
